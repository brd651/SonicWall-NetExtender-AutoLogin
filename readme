Built based on screenshots from SonicWall NetExtender 8.6.263 on Windows OS.   

This script will automatically login and if it detects if the application is not running or 
the service is not running it will go and start them. 

This script will need to be run with admin priviledges as it has to have access to the Services of Windows.   

Also, this only currently works when the Application is opened onto the main monitor.
